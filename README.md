# Fashion-MNIST Clustering and Dimensionality Reduction

## Overview
This project is developed by four undergraduate students of the Computer Science Department as part of our Machine Learning class. It focuses on applying various dimensionality reduction techniques and clustering algorithms to the Fashion-MNIST dataset, a collection of 28x28 grayscale images of 10 fashion categories. Our goal is to explore and evaluate the effectiveness of different methods in grouping similar fashion items together, thereby demonstrating the practical applications of machine learning techniques in image classification and clustering.

## Features
- Utilizes TensorFlow to load and preprocess the Fashion-MNIST dataset.
- Applies PCA, Stacked Autoencoder, and LDA for dimensionality reduction.
- Implements clustering with MiniBatch KMeans, DBSCAN, and Agglomerative Clustering algorithms.
- Evaluates clustering performance using metrics like Calinski-Harabasz Index, Davies-Bouldin Index, Silhouette Score, and Adjusted Rand Index Score.
- Visualizes reduced data and clustering results for comprehensive analysis.
